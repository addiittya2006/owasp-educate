**Note: Currently we don't support Profile Editing or Password Reset, So you'll have to remember the username or password you signup with or you'll need to signup again.**
<br><br>
After you are signed in successfully, you are taken to a screen like this,
![signedin](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B-lUWKmJuey_TkRHMXhkYUh1X3M)<br>
From Here you can browse on head with the articles, existing Categories and Feedback existing in the Database. You can view it from here but creation of new articles and Categories & Tags etc. is Admin only.
So you'll have to click the Button **Become a Writer** to notify the admins that you want to become a writer.
